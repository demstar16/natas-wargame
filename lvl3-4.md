- This was a tricky one, so the big takeaway is that google uses robot.txt to provide information for web crawlers.
- In this case when we go to "/robots.txt", we can see that "s3cr3t" is disallowed.
- That doesn't mean we can't get to it, just web crawlers can't, so if we go there we find users.txt and in there is the password.
